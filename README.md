# RuskOS

A kernel is the core program around which an operating system is built. Utilising a custom inhouse kernel can mitigate potential telemetry and spyware built into an operating system such as Windows.

Tanya Von Degourachaff was delivering a package on behalf of Doktor Wilhelm Voigt that contained such a kernel. It was a little program called the Kreschnder cipher, A kernel written in Rust that contained a unique text pattern required to activate their new state-of-the-art aerial defence system.

Unfortunately, the kernel sustained some damage due to an enemy ambush on the way to the destination. Now itâ€™s up to you, a field engineer Dingus to restore the kernel before shipping it back out.

## Objectives:
- Resolve the syntax errors
- Change the background color to black and text color to yellow
- Correct the keyboard port address to correct port address for the x86 architecture
- Correct the inverted text input

## Expected output:
![output](https://github.com/amfoss/tasks/blob/2023/task-10/output.gif)

## Requirements:
- Rust nightly
- Qemu

## Some pointers:
- The source code is located at the src/ directory
- The bulk of the incorrect code is primarily located at the following files:
  - main.rs
  - interrupts.rs
  - vga_buffer.rs
- The passcode is "amfoss"

## How to run it:
This guide will walk you through the setup process of the RuskOS kernel. Follow the steps below to install Rust (nightly), QEMU, and other necessary tools.

### Step 1: Install Rust and Rustup

First, we need to install Rust and Rustup, the toolchain installer for Rust.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Install Rust and Rustup by running the following command:
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

### Step 2: Install Rust Nightly

1. RuskOS requires the nightly version of Rust. Install it with the following commands:

    ```sh
    rustup toolchain install nightly
    ```

2. Set the default toolchain to nightly:

    ```sh
    rustup default nightly
    ```
### Step 3: Install QEMU

1. QEMU is needed to emulate the hardware for running the RuskOS kernel.
  - Update your package list:
    - On Ubuntu/Debian:
      ```sh
      sudo apt update
        ```
    - On Fedora:
      ```sh
      sudo dnf update
        ```
    - Install QEMU and related packages:

      - Debian/Ubuntu:
       ```sh
      sudo apt-get install qemu-system
        ```
    - Fedora:
      ```sh
      sudo dnf install @virtualization
      ```
      - MacOs:
        1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already:
           ```sh
           /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
           ```
        2. Install QEMU:
            ```sh
            brew install qemu
            ```
### Step 4: Running the app

1. Clone the RuskOS Repository
   Clone the RuskOS repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/sabarixr/Rusk_OS.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
        cd Rusk_OS
    ```
3. Install Bootimage:

   Bootimage is a tool that creates bootable disk images from your Rust kernel.
  - Install Bootimage by running:
       ```sh
       cargo install bootimage
       ```

4. Add LLVM Tools Preview Component:

   LLVM tools are required for building the kernel.
  - Add the LLVM tools component:
    ```sh
    rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
    ```

5. Build and Run the Kernel
  - Build the kernel:
    ```sh
    cargo +nightly build -Z build-std --target x86_64-rusk.json
    ```
6. Run the kernel using QEMU:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```
